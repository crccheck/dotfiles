#Sublime Text 2 - Coffee Compile

This package allows you to compile some or all of your CoffeeScript right from the editor.
The JavaScript output will even have syntax highlighting!


##Usage

Just highlight some CoffeeScript code, right click and select the _Coffee Compile_ command.
To compile the whole file, don't highlight any text.


## Common Issues

### OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory

This is happening because the plugin can't find `coffee` (or `coffee.cmd` on Windows). To fix this,
set the `coffee_path` to the executable's directory.

If you don't know where `coffee` is, run the following in your terminal: ``dirname `which coffee` ``

### env: node: No such file or directory

This is happening because `coffee` can't find your `node` executable. To fix this, set the `node_path` setting
to the executable's directory.

If you don't know where `node` is, run the following in your terminal: ``dirname `which node` ``
