## Installation

    git clone -b SublimeText2 git://github.com/kuroir/SCSS.tmbundle.git SCSS

## Before Forking

[READ THE README ON THE MASTER BRANCH!](https://github.com/kuroir/SCSS.tmbundle/blob/master/README.markdown)

## Troubleshooting

If you get an "Error loading syntax file" ([example](http://d.pr/RSdi)), perform the following steps:

1. Open any .scss file
2. From the menu, select: View → Syntax → CSS
3. From the menu, select: View → Syntax → SCSS

This will clear the ST2 syntax cache for SCSS. See [issue #48](https://github.com/kuroir/SCSS.tmbundle/issues/48#issuecomment-1710508) for background information.
