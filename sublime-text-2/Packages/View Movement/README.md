# Sublime View Movement

## Installation
Install via [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control).

## Usage

Adds more view movement commands to Sublime Text 2. This allows you to move the cursor from view (pane) to view and move views to different layouts.

⌘+⇧+(H,K,L,M) = Move the cursor Up/Left/Right/Down

⌘+⌃+(H,K,L,M) = Move the current view and cursor Up/Left/Right/Down. This changes the current pane that a view is in.
